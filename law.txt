General Knowledge:
Introduction: New Jersey’s divorce law is governed by state statutes and case law, administered through the Family Part of the New Jersey Superior Court. The primary statutory framework is found in Title 2A, Chapter 34 of the New Jersey Statutes, which covers divorce (also termed dissolution of marriage) and related matters. New Jersey recognizes both absolute divorce and a limited form of divorce (known as “divorce from bed and board”), the latter being a legal separation that does not fully dissolve the marriage​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. Over the years, New Jersey’s legislature and courts have modernized divorce law – for example, introducing no-fault divorce in 2007 – to reflect contemporary views on marriage and equitable outcomes​
TTNLAW.COM
​
TTNLAW.COM
. Statutes outline the grounds for divorce, procedures for filing, and principles for financial and custodial determinations, while court decisions (especially from the New Jersey Supreme Court) interpret those statutes and establish guiding precedents. In essence, a New Jersey divorce proceeding is a civil lawsuit in which the court, applying state law, can terminate the marital status and decide issues of property division, alimony, and child custody/support in a fair manner. The following sections provide a comprehensive overview of New Jersey divorce law’s key components, serving as a knowledge base of both fundamental principles and specific details.
Grounds for Divorce in New Jersey
No-Fault Grounds: New Jersey allows divorce on no-fault grounds, meaning neither spouse must prove the other did wrong. The two no-fault bases are “irreconcilable differences” and 18-month separation. Irreconcilable differences – added to the law in 2007 – require that the marriage has been broken for at least six months with no reasonable chance of reconciliation​
TTNLAW.COM
. This simply means one or both spouses feel the relationship has irreparably failed (no specific misconduct is alleged). Alternatively, spouses who have lived apart in separate residences for at least 18 consecutive months with no prospect of reconciling can divorce on that ground​
SARNOLAWFIRM.COM
. No-fault filings allow couples to dissolve the marriage without airing personal wrongdoing in public records​
TTNLAW.COM
. Fault Grounds: Despite the prevalence of no-fault divorce, New Jersey law also recognizes traditional fault-based grounds under N.J.S.A. 2A:34-2​
TTNLAW.COM
. These require proof of misconduct or specific conditions and include: (1) Adultery, when a spouse has had an extramarital sexual affair; (2) Willful and continuous desertion for 12 or more months, meaning one spouse abandoned the other or willfully ceased cohabitation for at least a year​
TTNLAW.COM
; (3) Extreme cruelty, which covers physical or mental cruelty endangering the spouse’s safety or health (courts often require that the cruelty occurred at least 3 months before filing to ensure it’s not a rash decision); (4) Addiction or habitual drunkenness for 12+ consecutive months after the marriage began​
TTNLAW.COM
; (5) Institutionalization for mental illness for 24 or more months (the spouse has been confined to a mental health institution for at least two years)​
TTNLAW.COM
; (6) Imprisonment of the spouse for 18 or more months after the marriage​
TTNLAW.COM
; and (7) Deviant sexual conduct voluntarily performed by the defendant without the plaintiff’s consent​
TTNLAW.COM
. If a fault ground is used, the filing spouse must present evidence to prove that misconduct (e.g. hiring a private investigator to document adultery, or providing medical records for institutionalization). Notably, New Jersey is a “no-fault” state in its approach to outcomes – meaning that choosing a fault ground usually does not lead to a better financial settlement or greater advantage in court. In fact, except in cases of severe economic harm or truly egregious behavior, courts do not consider marital fault when dividing property or awarding alimony​
SARNOLAWFIRM.COM
. For example, a judge will typically not award more assets or support to an innocent spouse just because the other committed adultery. Only if the misconduct had a direct financial impact (such as one spouse recklessly spending marital assets on an affair) or is extraordinarily egregious will it factor into the financial decisions​
SARNOLAWFIRM.COM
. In summary, New Jersey law provides many grounds for divorce, but since the advent of irreconcilable differences most cases proceed without assigning blame, consistent with the state’s modern policy of dissolving marriages with minimal acrimony.
Filing for Divorce: Procedure and Requirements
Residency Requirement: To file for divorce in New Jersey, one of the spouses must have been a bona fide resident of the state for at least one year immediately prior to filing​
WOMENSLAW.ORG
. The only exception is for adultery-based divorces – if the grounds are adultery that occurred in New Jersey, a complaint can be filed without a full year of residency​
WOMENSLAW.ORG
. (In adultery cases, jurisdiction exists as long as one spouse is a New Jersey resident when filing and the adulterous act occurred in New Jersey.) For all other grounds – whether no-fault or fault – the 12-month residency ensures New Jersey courts have authority over the marriage. Initiating the Case: A divorce case begins with the Complaint for Divorce, filed in the Superior Court, Family Division, in the county where the cause of action arose or where either party resides. The complaint is a legal document stating the essential facts, the ground for divorce, and the relief sought (such as division of property, alimony, child custody/support)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Along with the complaint, the filing party (the plaintiff) must include several required documents. Key filings include a Certification of Verification and Non-Collusion, in which the plaintiff swears the truth of the complaint and that it’s not filed for any improper purpose​
NJCOURTS.GOV
, and a Summons to officially notify the other spouse (the defendant) of the lawsuit​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. New Jersey also requires a Confidential Litigant Information Sheet, providing basic personal information under seal​
NJCOURTS.GOV
, and for self-represented litigants, a certification that they have read informational material about dispute resolution alternatives​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Additionally, parties must exchange a Certification of Insurance Coverage (listing all known insurance policies)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
 to prevent changes in coverage during the divorce, and if any financial issues (support, alimony, equitable distribution) or custody are in dispute, each party must file a detailed Case Information Statement (CIS)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. The CIS is a financial disclosure form itemizing income, expenses, assets, and debts, which is crucial for the court when deciding monetary matters. Method of Filing: The complaint and accompanying forms are filed with the Family Division of the Superior Court. New Jersey allows electronic filing through the Judiciary Electronic Document Submission (JEDS) system or filing in person or by mail with the court clerk​
NJCOURTS.GOV
​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. A filing fee of $300 is required for the complaint (plus a $25 parenting education fee if child custody or parenting time is an issue)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Once filed, the court will assign a docket number to the case and issue the summons. Service of Process: After filing, the plaintiff must “serve” the defendant with copies of the summons, complaint, and all filed documents, within 60 days of the filing date​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Proper service is typically done by having the County Sheriff deliver the papers or by hiring a process server, or by any method the defendant acknowledges and waives (such as signed acceptance for certified mail)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Proof of service must be filed with the court to show the defendant was notified​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Once served, the defendant has 35 days to respond​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
. The defendant may file an Answer (responding to each allegation and potentially raising defenses) or an Answer and Counterclaim (responding and also requesting divorce on their own grounds), or simply file an Appearance if not contesting grounds but wanting to be heard on relief. If the defendant fails to respond within 35 days, the plaintiff can request an entry of default, and the case may proceed without the defendant’s participation​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
. The Divorce Process: If the defendant answers and the case is contested, the litigation moves into the pre-trial phase. The court will typically issue a Case Management Order scheduling necessary steps like discovery deadlines. The spouses exchange financial information (via CIS and discovery tools such as interrogatories, document requests, depositions) to ensure full disclosure of income, assets, and debts. New Jersey court rules also provide for pendente lite (temporary) motions – for example, a spouse can request temporary support or a parenting time order to be in place while the divorce is pending. As the case progresses, New Jersey strongly encourages settlement. Courts require participation in an Early Settlement Panel (ESP) once discovery is substantially complete​
COHENSEGLIAS.COM
. The ESP is a mandatory, non-binding process where two experienced family law attorneys (as volunteers) review the financial aspects of the case and offer a recommended settlement for issues like property division, alimony, and child support​
COHENSEGLIAS.COM
. (Custody issues are handled separately, often via mediation.) If both parties accept the ESP recommendations, a settlement is reached and can be put on the record that day, greatly expediting the conclusion of the case​
MORRISDOWNINGSHERRED.COM
. If the case does not settle at ESP, the court will usually order the parties to attend economic mediation with a trained mediator to continue settlement efforts. Throughout this process, the option of mediation for custody disputes is also available (and in some counties, initial custody/visitation mediation is required before a court hearing). Should settlement efforts fail on some or all issues, the matter will be scheduled for a trial before a judge (there are no jury trials in divorce). At trial, each side presents evidence and witness testimony, and the judge will issue a Final Judgment of Divorce resolving all outstanding issues. Notably, New Jersey does not impose a statutory waiting period before a divorce can be finalized (beyond the grounds requirements and procedural timelines), so an uncontested no-fault divorce can be granted as soon as the parties have a signed settlement and can get a hearing date – theoretically in a few months. Conversely, a complex contested divorce that proceeds to trial may take many months or over a year to conclude. Once the judgment of divorce is entered, the marriage is terminated and each party is free to remarry (or in the case of a civil union, to enter a new civil union). The judgment will incorporate any settlement agreement or contain the court’s rulings on all issues. Overall, the filing and process for divorce in New Jersey is designed to ensure both parties are treated fairly and have ample opportunity to negotiate an agreement, with court intervention as a last resort when amicable resolution is not achievable.
Division of Property (Equitable Distribution)
One of the most significant aspects of any divorce is the division of the couple’s assets and debts. New Jersey follows the doctrine of equitable distribution, codified in N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23.1, which directs courts to divide marital property in a fair and just manner, though not necessarily a 50/50 split​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. The term “equitable” implies consideration of many factors to reach a fair allocation for each spouse. Marital vs. Separate Property: A crucial first step is distinguishing marital property from each spouse’s separate property. Under New Jersey law, marital property generally includes all property “legally and beneficially acquired” by either or both spouses during the marriage (from the date of marriage to the date the divorce complaint is filed, in most cases)​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
. This encompasses real estate, earnings, savings, investments, retirement accounts, business interests, personal property, and even less tangible assets like stock options or banked vacation days – virtually every conceivable asset earned or accumulated during the marriage is subject to distribution​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
. It does not matter whose name is on the title or who paid for an asset; if it was acquired with marital funds or efforts during the marriage, the court can treat it as joint property regardless of formal ownership​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
. Separate property, on the other hand, includes assets that a spouse owned before the marriage, and certain assets acquired during the marriage by specific exempt means (for example, inheritances or gifts from a third party to one spouse alone, which by statute are typically exempt from equitable distribution, as long as they were kept separate). The New Jersey Supreme Court has explicitly affirmed that property one spouse brings into the marriage remains that spouse’s separate property and is not subject to division in divorce​
LAWPIPE.COM
. In the landmark case Painter v. Painter (1974), the Court held that “any property owned by a husband or wife at the time of marriage will remain the separate property of such spouse and ... will not qualify as an asset eligible for distribution”​
LAWPIPE.COM
. Furthermore, if a pre-marital asset increases in value during the marriage, that passive increase (e.g. market appreciation) is generally also immune from distribution, absent evidence that the other spouse substantially contributed to that increase​
LAWPIPE.COM
​
LAWPIPE.COM
. For example, if Wife owned a house before marriage worth $100,000 and by the time of divorce it’s worth $150,000, the $50,000 gain would typically remain her separate property – unless Husband can show his actions contributed to the increase (such as he paid for renovations that boosted the value). Likewise, income produced by separate property (say, rent from that house, or dividends from a pre-marital stock holding) is treated as separate property of the owning spouse​
LAWPIPE.COM
, so long as it hasn’t been intermingled with marital funds. On the other hand, assets acquired during the marriage – even if only in one spouse’s name – are usually marital. Painter drew a clear line: assets acquired during coverture (the marriage) due to the effort of either spouse are subject to distribution​
LAWPIPE.COM
. This means if both spouses worked and earned money, all savings and purchases from those earnings are marital; if one spouse was the sole breadwinner and the other a homemaker, the earnings of the worker are marital property and the homemaker’s contributions are equally valued in the eyes of the law when dividing the estate. New Jersey law presumes marriage is a “shared enterprise” and a partnership​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
, so both financial and non-financial contributions (like raising children or maintaining the home) are recognized. Equitable Distribution Factors: Once the marital estate is identified and valued, the court (or the parties by agreement) must decide how to divide it equitably. Equitable does not always mean equal, though in many long-term marriages a roughly equal split is common unless factors suggest otherwise. New Jersey statutes enumerate a detailed list of factors for courts to consider, ensuring the division is tailored to the case​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. These factors, found in N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23.1, include, for example: the duration of the marriage​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 (generally, longer marriages support a more equal division as spouses’ finances have been deeply interdependent, whereas in a short marriage a court might aim to restore each to their pre-marital position); the age and physical/emotional health of the parties​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the income and property brought into the marriage by each party (what each had at the start)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the standard of living established during the marriage​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the existence of any prenuptial or mid-marriage agreements about property​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the economic circumstances of each spouse at the time of divorce (looking at what each will have after distribution)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; each party’s income and earning capacity, education and employability​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; contributions by each party to the marital property, including contributions as a homemaker or by caring for children, and contributions to the other’s career or education​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; whether either party dissipated or wasted assets during the marriage (for example, spending marital funds on an affair or gambling – if so, the court may credit the other spouse with a larger share)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the tax consequences of the proposed distribution​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the present value of the assets (important for pensions or delayed benefits)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the needs of a custodial parent to keep the marital home for the benefit of the children​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the debts and liabilities of the parties​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; and any other factors the court finds relevant to reach a fair outcome​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. The statute requires the judge to make specific findings on these factors for the record​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. In practice, equitable distribution in New Jersey is a three-step process: (1) determine what property is marital and thus eligible for distribution, (2) determine the value of each such asset, and (3) decide on the equitable division of each asset (or of the estate as a whole)​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
. For instance, in Rothman v. Rothman (1974) the court described this process, which is now standard​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
. Notably, New Jersey law creates a rebuttable presumption that each spouse contributed in some fashion to acquisitions during the marriage​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. This means even if one spouse earned all the money, the law presumes the other spouse’s contributions (domestic labor, supporting the earner, etc.) facilitated those acquisitions, so both have a claim. Overall, the goal is to leave each party with a fair share of the marital wealth. Courts have considerable discretion – for example, a judge might give a larger portion of assets to a spouse who has significantly lower earning potential or greater child-rearing responsibilities post-divorce, or might distribute specific assets in-kind (each party getting certain items) versus ordering a sale and splitting proceeds. Separate property is not divided – e.g., each keeps their pre-marital assets – though sometimes disputes arise about whether an asset is separate or marital (e.g., if separate property was commingled with marital funds or retitled jointly, it may become marital in whole or part). In complex cases, expert appraisals are used for businesses, real estate, pensions, etc., to ensure accurate valuation. New Jersey also allows unequal distribution if supported by the factors – for instance, if one spouse heavily wasted marital assets or the marriage was very short, a court could award a greater percentage to one side to be equitable. As a practical matter, many couples negotiate property division in a Marital Settlement Agreement with the guidance of these factors, and judges typically approve agreements as long as they appear fair. Once the equitable distribution is ordered (whether by agreement or court decision), it becomes part of the divorce judgment and is generally final (property division awards are not modifiable later, except in cases of fraud or similar extraordinary circumstances).
Alimony (Spousal Support)
Alimony in New Jersey is governed by N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23 and is intended to provide financial support to a dependent spouse after divorce, when appropriate. In 2014, New Jersey’s alimony statute was significantly revised – eliminating the terminology of “permanent alimony” in favor of “open durational alimony,” and setting new guidelines for the duration of awards – to reflect contemporary norms. There are four types of alimony that a court may award (either singly or in combination) in a New Jersey divorce: open durational, limited duration, rehabilitative, and reimbursement​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. Each serves a different purpose, and the applicability depends on the circumstances of the marriage and divorce.
Open Durational Alimony: This replaced what was formerly called “permanent” alimony. Open durational alimony is typically awarded in long-term marriages (usually 20 years or more in length)​
DIVORCELAWYERS1.COM
​
CENTRALJERSEYFAMILYLAW.COM
. It has no fixed end date – the paying spouse provides support indefinitely, until or unless a court modifies or terminates it upon a substantial change in circumstances. Under the 2014 reforms, for marriages lasting less than 20 years, the duration of alimony cannot exceed the length of the marriage except in exceptional circumstances​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. In other words, only very long marriages presumptively qualify for open-ended alimony; if a marriage was, say, 15 years, any alimony would normally be capped at 15 years in duration. Open durational alimony is meant to continue until the supported spouse remarries or either party dies (by law, alimony ends if the recipient remarries or the payor dies), or until the payor reaches full retirement age, at which point they can ask the court to terminate or adjust alimony on the basis of retirement​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. (New Jersey law provides that reaching full retirement age – as defined by Social Security, currently around 67 – constitutes a prima facie ground to end or modify alimony, absent proof of extenuating circumstances​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
.) Thus, open durational alimony generally provides ongoing support for an indeterminate period, appropriate when a spouse sacrificed career opportunities or is unlikely to become self-supporting at a comparable standard of living after a long marriage.
Limited Duration Alimony: This form of alimony is awarded for a fixed term of years. It is typically used for marriages of intermediate length or in situations where the recipient spouse needs support for some time but is expected to become self-sufficient, or at least less dependent, in the foreseeable future. For example, after a 10-year marriage, a court might award limited duration alimony for (say) 5 or 6 years. The term must be specified in the court order or agreement. Limited duration alimony terminates at the end of the term, but can be modified in amount or duration if the supporting spouse or recipient shows changed circumstances before the term is up (unless the parties agreed to non-modifiable term). However, it generally will not be extended beyond the original length except in unusual situations (“exceptional circumstances”).
Rehabilitative Alimony: This is a short-term support to enable a dependent spouse to become self-supporting – essentially, an investment in the spouse’s ability to rehabilitate their earning capacity​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. It is often awarded when the recipient has a specific plan (such as finishing a degree, obtaining job training, or re-entering the workforce) and needs financial help for a limited period to achieve that plan. For instance, if a spouse left a career to raise children, rehabilitative alimony might fund a return to school or updated training so that within a few years the spouse can earn a sufficient living. The recipient is typically expected to diligently pursue the outlined plan. Courts can retain jurisdiction to review progress, and rehabilitative alimony can be modified or extended if the planned rehabilitation efforts do not materialize through no fault of the recipient (or terminated if the recipient fails to make efforts).
Reimbursement Alimony: This type is designed to repay one spouse for expenses they incurred or sacrifices made to support the other spouse’s education or career training. A classic example is where one spouse worked and put the other through an advanced degree (medical school, law school, etc.) with the expectation of enjoying the higher income later, but then the marriage ends before they realize that benefit. The supporting spouse may receive reimbursement alimony as a lump sum or installments to compensate for their financial contributions toward the other’s education or career advancement​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. Unlike other alimony, it is not based on need, but on fair repayment of contributions.
When deciding whether to award alimony and in what amount and type, New Jersey courts must consider all relevant factors, outlined in the statute. There are 14 statutory factors for alimony determinations​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
, which largely mirror the equitable distribution factors and focus on the financial need of one party and the ability of the other to pay​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. Some key alimony factors include: the actual need of the dependent spouse and the other spouse’s ability to pay​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the duration of the marriage (longer marriages more strongly support longer-duration or open durational alimony)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the age and physical/emotional health of each party​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the standard of living established during the marriage, and the likelihood that each can maintain a reasonably comparable standard post-divorce​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 (this factor essentially looks at the marital lifestyle – in New Jersey, the law seeks to ensure neither spouse unreasonably falls into poverty or climbs to undue prosperity relative to that joint lifestyle; in a long marriage, both are entitled to a similar lifestyle if finances permit​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
); the earning capacities, education, and employability of each spouse​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the length of time the dependent spouse was out of the job market (for example, a homemaker for many years may have diminished earning capacity)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; parental responsibilities for the children​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 (a parent with primary custody might not be able to work full-time, affecting need or ability to pay); the time and expense necessary for the dependent to acquire education or training to find employment and become self-supporting​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the history of financial or non-financial contributions to the marriage by each party, including childcare and homemaking (and any career sacrifices)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the equitable distribution of property and any payouts from that (since the assets a spouse receives in the divorce can affect their need for support)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; and the tax consequences of alimony​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 (under federal tax law changes effective 2019, new alimony awards are no longer tax-deductible to the payor nor taxable to the recipient, but existing agreements might differ – New Jersey’s statute still notes tax impact as a factor). The court can also consider “any other factors” deemed relevant​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. No one factor is supposed to dominate; the court weighs them holistically​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. Ultimately, alimony is awarded only if one spouse is left with a significant economic need and the other has the ability to pay, after equitable distribution and considering both post-divorce budgets. Duration and Modification: As noted, limited duration alimony ends after a set period; rehabilitative ends when the goal is met or time runs out; reimbursement ends after the amount is paid. Open durational continues indefinitely but is subject to future review. All alimony (except true reimbursement which is more like a debt) can be modified or terminated upon a “change in circumstances.” New Jersey law expressly permits modification of alimony based on changed circumstances​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
. This principle was established in the seminal case Lepis v. Lepis (1980), which held that even if a divorce agreement set alimony, the court retains power to revise it if circumstances substantially change​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
. For example, if the payor spouse involuntarily loses a high-paying job and can no longer afford the same payments, or conversely if the recipient becomes financially independent, these would be grounds to seek an adjustment. The burden is on the party seeking the change to demonstrate a significant change in financial situation since the original order​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
. Typically, courts look for changes that are permanent, not temporary or self-created​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
. As part of the 2014 amendments, New Jersey law also addresses retirement of the payor and cohabitation by the recipient as specific change in circumstance events. When the payor reaches full retirement age, there’s a presumption alimony should end – unless the recipient shows why it should continue (e.g., extreme need)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. If a payor seeks to retire early (before full retirement age), they must prove the retirement is reasonable and made in good faith​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. On the other side, if a recipient cohabitates with another person in a marriage-like relationship, the court may suspend or terminate alimony. New Jersey’s statute defines cohabitation as a “mutually supportive, intimate personal relationship” akin to marriage, even if the couple does not necessarily live together full-time​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. Factors such as intertwined finances, shared living arrangements, and recognition of the relationship by friends and family are considered to determine cohabitation​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. If cohabitation is found, alimony can be ended because the recipient has formed a new household for support. Additionally, by law alimony automatically terminates upon the remarriage of the recipient (except for reimbursement alimony)​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
, and no alimony runs beyond the death of either party (estates aren’t bound to continue payments, though arrears up to death are collectable). Marital Fault and Alimony: As mentioned in the Grounds section, New Jersey generally does not consider marital misconduct in setting alimony, except in two narrow circumstances. The New Jersey Supreme Court in Mani v. Mani (2005) reaffirmed that “marital fault is irrelevant to alimony” determinations except: (1) if the misconduct had a financial impact on the marital estate or the needs of a party (e.g., economic fraud or dissipation of assets by a spouse may be factored in to prevent unfair benefit), or (2) in the extremely rare case of egregious misconduct that directly affects the post-divorce economic equity (the often-cited example is a spouse who attempted to murder the other – courts have found such shocking conduct could justify denying alimony even if that spouse might otherwise be eligible)​
STUDICATA.COM
. Ordinary fault like adultery or verbal abuse is not a basis to adjust alimony. This reflects that alimony’s purpose is financial fairness and support, not to punish wrongdoing. In sum, alimony in New Jersey is a nuanced remedy to mitigate the economic disparities that divorce can create. It aims to ensure that a dependent spouse isn’t left destitute or at a vastly lower standard of living because of divorce, while balancing the payor’s capacity and right to move on. Alimony awards are highly case-specific: in some divorces no alimony is awarded at all (if both spouses are self-supporting or the marriage was short), whereas in others a significant long-term alimony is ordered. The trend in New Jersey has been toward limited term alimony where feasible, reserving open-ended obligations for longer marriages or clear need, and encouraging both parties toward financial independence to the extent possible.
Child Custody and Support
Child Custody: In any divorce involving minor children, determining custody and parenting time (visitation) arrangements is paramount. New Jersey’s custody laws center on the “best interests of the child” standard. Under N.J.S.A. 9:2-4, the rights of both parents are equal in custody matters​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 – there is no presumption favoring one parent over the other based on gender or other factors. It is the state’s public policy to assure children frequent and continuing contact with both parents after divorce, and to encourage parents to share child-rearing responsibilities​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. In practice, this means New Jersey courts often favor some form of joint custody when feasible, or at least ensure the non-custodial parent gets significant parenting time, absent issues such as abuse. New Jersey law recognizes two aspects of custody: legal custody (decision-making authority for important issues like the child’s health, education, and welfare) and physical custody (where and with whom the child lives on a day-to-day basis). Joint legal custody is very common – in most cases, both parents continue to share in major decisions about the child. Physical custody can be arranged as joint (the child spends significant time residing with each parent, which could be an equal split or some other division) or sole (the child primarily lives with one “custodial parent” and has scheduled visitation with the other). When one parent is designated the parent of primary residence (primary custodial parent) and the other the parent of alternate residence, the parenting time schedule will specify alternating weekends, weekdays, holidays, vacations, etc., to ensure the child maintains a strong relationship with both. Courts ultimately must craft custody arrangements (or approve the parents’ agreement) that serve the child’s best interests. By statute, judges consider a list of factors when determining the child’s best interests​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. These factors include: the ability of the parents to agree, communicate and cooperate regarding the child​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 (high conflict between parents might impede true joint custody); the willingness of each parent to accept custody and any history of unwillingness to allow visitation (a parent who tried to thwart the other’s contact without good reason may be viewed negatively)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the interaction and relationship of the child with parents and siblings (courts assess the existing bonds – e.g., who has been the primary caregiver, the child’s relationship with siblings or half-siblings)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; any history of domestic violence by either parent​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the safety of the child and safety of either parent from the other (if there’s domestic violence, the court will ensure protections in place and that custody/visitation arrangements account for safety)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the preference of the child if the child is of sufficient age and maturity to form an intelligent preference (while there is no fixed age, teenagers’ preferences may carry weight, though the court is not bound by them)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the needs of the child (including special needs, if any)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the stability of the home environment offered by each parent​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the quality and continuity of the child’s education (courts try to minimize disruption – for example, not uprooting a child from a school mid-year if avoidable)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the fitness of the parents (this can encompass physical and mental health, habits, lifestyle as it affects the child – e.g., substance abuse issues)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the geographical proximity of the parents’ homes (distance affects feasibility of schedules)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the extent and quality of time spent with the child before or since separation (if one parent was largely absent or uninvolved, that might impact the custody plan)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; the parents’ employment responsibilities (work schedules can affect who is available to care for the child at certain times)​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
; and the age and number of children (if there are multiple children, keeping siblings together is often a priority, and the children’s ages can make certain arrangements more suitable). Importantly, no parent is deemed unfit unless their conduct has a substantial adverse effect on the child​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. So even a parent with personal shortcomings is usually entitled to some custody or visitation unless those issues seriously harm the child. The court may also appoint a guardian ad litem or attorney for the child in high-conflict cases to represent the child’s interests​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
, though this is not routine. If parents can agree on a custody arrangement, the court will normally approve it as long as it appears to serve the child’s welfare. In fact, the law says the court shall order any custody arrangement agreed to by both parents unless it is contrary to the child’s best interests​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. This encourages parents to develop a Parenting Plan cooperatively. A parenting plan typically details whether custody is joint or sole, the residential schedule (weekly routines, holiday rotation, vacation time), and how future decisions will be made (for example, requiring consultation on major issues). If parents cannot agree, the court may require each to submit a proposed custody plan​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
 and may refer the couple to mediation (many New Jersey counties mandate mediation for custody/visitation disputes at the early stage). Ultimately, if no agreement is reached, the judge will hold a custody hearing or trial to take evidence (including expert evaluations if needed – sometimes a mental health professional performs a custody evaluation). The resulting custody order will specify legal custody (usually joint unless one parent is truly unfit or unavailable) and physical custody terms. New Jersey also recognizes that circumstances can change. Custody orders are modifiable upon a showing of changed circumstances affecting the child’s best interests. For instance, if one parent plans to relocate far away, or if a parent’s situation substantially improves or worsens (e.g., recovery from addiction, or developing a health issue), the court can reconsider the custody arrangement. One particularly sensitive issue is relocation or removing the child from New Jersey – previously, a parent with primary custody could relocate out-of-state if they demonstrated a good faith reason and that the move was not inimical to the child, but a 2017 New Jersey Supreme Court case (see Bisbing v. Bisbing below) established that when parents share legal custody, any relocation that affects the parenting time of the other parent must be decided by a pure best-interests-of-the-child analysis. This means the court will evaluate the move as if deciding initial custody, not presumptively favoring the primary custodian. Thus, a parent seeking to relocate with the child needs either agreement from the other parent or court approval based on the child’s best interests. Generally, New Jersey courts are cautious about moves that would substantially disrupt the child’s relationship with the other parent. Child Support: Both parents in New Jersey have a legal obligation to support their children. Child support is the financial contribution from the non-custodial parent (and sometimes an adjustment from the custodial parent) to cover the child’s living expenses. New Jersey employs Child Support Guidelines – a standardized formula set by Court Rule – to calculate support in the majority of cases (usually applicable when the parents’ combined net income is below a certain threshold, roughly $187,000 per year; above that, the guidelines apply to the base amount and courts can add discretionary amounts for the excess income). The Guidelines follow an “Income Shares” model, which assumes that a child should receive the same proportion of parental income they would have if the household remained intact​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
​
LAW.JUSTIA.COM
. In simple terms, the incomes of both parents are added to determine a total support amount, then that obligation is apportioned between the parents based on their relative incomes. The parent who has primary physical custody is presumed to directly spend their share on the child; the other parent pays their share as child support to the custodial parent. The formula also takes into account the number of children and the parenting time arrangement (the Guidelines allow adjustments if the non-custodial parent has the children for a significant number of overnights, recognizing they directly incur expenses during those times). The resulting guideline award covers the child’s basic needs – housing, food, clothing, transportation, entertainment, unreimbursed health care up to $250/year, etc. Certain expenses like child care or extraordinary medical costs are added on top of the base support as governed by the rules. Courts may deviate from the guideline amount if application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, but they must state reasons. Some common adjustments include allocating payment of health insurance premiums for the child, or education expenses. If the parents’ income is very high, the court will calculate the maximum guideline amount and then consider the child’s reasonable needs for any additional support from the excess income. In any event, child support is determined so as to best provide for the child’s financial welfare, and both parents’ resources are considered (even if one has no income, the court may impute income if they are capable of working, or at least note the other is providing the bulk of support). Duration of Support: New Jersey law was updated in 2017 regarding when child support ends. Under the current law, child support terminates by default when the child reaches 19 years of age (the age of majority) unless an exception applies​
NJCHILDSUPPORT.ORG
. The law provides that support can be extended up to age 23 if the child is still in high school, still pursuing full-time post-secondary education (college/vocational school), or is disabled, or if the court approves another reason to extend​
NJCHILDSUPPORT.ORG
. In effect, if a child at 19 is in college, a parent can request continuation of support (and in most cases, it will continue, as most college students are not self-supporting). By age 23, however, support will end except in cases of a disabled adult child who remains financially dependent due to disability​
NJCHILDSUPPORT.ORG
. After 23, if the child is severely disabled, a parent may seek a court order for continued financial maintenance, but it would no longer be “child support” per se under the standard statute (it could be via a different mechanism, like a trust or continued family support order)​
NJCHILDSUPPORT.ORG
. In all cases, emancipation (the termination of the right to support) can occur earlier than 19 if the child is self-supporting, marries, or enters military service​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. For example, if an 18-year-old finishes high school and immediately works full-time and moves out on their own, a parent could move for emancipation and termination of support. The law now facilitates automatic termination at 19 by requiring the probation child support office to send notices to parents as the child nears 19, explaining how to request extension if appropriate​
NJCHILDSUPPORT.ORG
. It’s important to note that college education expenses are not automatically covered by child support once the child turns 18, but New Jersey is one of the few states that may compel parents (if able) to contribute to their child’s college costs. In the landmark case Newburgh v. Arrigo (1982), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that divorced parents may be required to contribute to a child’s higher education expenses, depending on many factors​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
. The Court listed a dozen factors such as whether the parent, if still living with the child, would have paid for college; the child’s academic aptitude and commitment; the financial resources of each parent and the child; the type of school and costs involved; and the relationship between the child and the parent (e.g., if the child has kept a relationship or is estranged)​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
. These principles still guide courts in resolving college cost disputes. Often, if parents can afford it, courts will allocate college costs between them (and sometimes part to the student via loans/work) separately from base child support. Many divorce settlement agreements pre-emptively address college, specifying how tuition will be handled. If not, a court can decide when the time comes. During college years, a child is usually not emancipated (thus still eligible for support), but the support may be adjusted since the parents may be paying college bills – frequently, basic child support is suspended or reduced while the child is away at school and costs are being paid, then possibly resumed during summer months when the child is home. Enforcement of Child Support: Once a child support order is in place, New Jersey has robust enforcement mechanisms to ensure it is paid. Child support orders are usually administered through the state’s probation department system, which keeps track of payments. Income withholding is required in most cases – meaning the support amount is automatically deducted from the payor’s paycheck and forwarded to the New Jersey Family Support Payment Center, which then disburses to the recipient parent. If a parent falls behind (creates an arrears), the probation Child Support Enforcement unit can take a variety of actions. These include scheduling enforcement hearings and, if necessary, the issuance of bench warrants for arrest of delinquent payors who fail to appear​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Other enforcement tools codified in state and federal law are automatic interception of tax refunds (federal and state) to apply to arrears​
NJCOURTS.GOV
, garnishment of bank accounts or placing liens on property to secure overdue support​
NJCOURTS.GOV
, reporting arrears as judgments and to credit bureaus which can damage credit​
NJCOURTS.GOV
, and even suspension of driver’s licenses or professional licenses for significant non-compliance​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. The program can also deny passports for those with substantial arrears​
NJCOURTS.GOV
 or seize lottery winnings and lawsuit settlements​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. In essence, unpaid child support is treated very seriously; falling behind can trigger immediate income garnishment and long-term consequences. New Jersey also participates in the federal and interstate enforcement system, so even if a parent moves out of state, support can be enforced across state lines (under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, and via cooperation with other states’ agencies)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Child support arrears (back due amounts) do not simply vanish – even if the child becomes an adult, the owed arrears remain collectible (the case may convert to an “arrears only” collection case after emancipation)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. Modification of child support is possible (like alimony) upon a showing of changed circumstances (e.g., significant change in either parent’s income, or if the child’s needs change), but until a modification is obtained, the ordered amount continues to accrue. Lastly, New Jersey law now generally ends current support at age 19 (absent extension)​
NJCOURTS.GOV
, but if there are arrears, enforcement continues until those are paid​
NJCOURTS.GOV
. In summary, child support is a right of the child, and New Jersey’s system works to ensure that support is paid timely and regularly, with strict measures for those who willfully evade their obligations.
Alternative Dispute Resolution in Divorce
Litigation in court is not the only path for divorce – New Jersey strongly encourages alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods to resolve divorce issues more amicably and efficiently. ADR options include mediation, arbitration, and collaborative divorce, each providing a way for parties to settle matters without extensive courtroom battles. Mediation: Mediation is a process in which a neutral third-party mediator facilitates the spouses’ negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable settlement. The mediator does not impose a decision but helps identify issues, improve communication, and explore compromise solutions. In New Jersey, mediation is widely used and often very successful in divorce cases. In fact, certain aspects are built into the system: custody and parenting time disputes are frequently referred to the court’s mediation program early on, and financial issues that aren’t resolved at the ESP (Early Settlement Panel) must go to economic mediation (with a mediator chosen from an approved roster) before a trial is scheduled. Mediation can also be initiated voluntarily at any time by the parties. Benefits of mediation include privacy (sessions are confidential and not part of public record), control (the spouses craft the agreement themselves rather than having a judge decide), and cost-effectiveness (it can be faster and cheaper than trial). It’s conducted in an informal, cooperative setting​
NJCOURTS.GOV
 – sometimes all in one room, or with the mediator shuttling between parties. The mediator may be an attorney or mental health professional trained in dispute resolution. While the mediator may outline how courts generally handle issues (to guide parties on what is reasonable), they remain neutral and do not give each side legal advice – parties may still consult their own attorneys during the process. Many New Jersey divorces reach a full settlement through mediation, rendering court appearances perfunctory (just to put the settlement on record and obtain the divorce judgment). Even partial mediation can narrow the issues, saving time. It’s important to note mediation is voluntary in that the parties must agree on the outcome – either party can stop mediation at any point or decide not to sign an agreement if they feel it’s unfair. Arbitration: Arbitration is essentially a private trial – the spouses hire a neutral arbitrator (often a retired judge or experienced family law attorney) to hear their case and render a decision. Arbitration can be binding or non-binding, but in family law it’s typically binding (with some limited court review for fairness, especially on custody matters, to ensure the result is in the child’s best interests). The benefits of arbitration include the ability to schedule proceedings at the parties’ convenience (rather than waiting for court dates), privacy (it’s conducted in private, not in open court), and often a faster resolution than the backlogged court system. Some high-asset or high-profile couples choose arbitration to keep financial information confidential and avoid media attention. In New Jersey, arbitration of financial issues is common and the courts will generally enforce a valid arbitration award on issues like equitable distribution or alimony. Arbitration of child custody is permissible but with safeguards – per the New Jersey Supreme Court’s ruling in Fawzy v. Fawzy (2009), parents can arbitrate custody disputes, but there must be a record and findings to allow court review to ensure the award protects the child’s interests. So, while an arbitrator’s decision on custody isn’t absolute (the court must ultimately make sure it’s not harmful to the child), arbitration can still be used to have a quicker decision by a chosen expert. Overall, arbitration is less common than mediation in divorce, but it’s a valuable option, particularly if the parties want a definitive decision on an issue but prefer not to go through public court. It can also be more flexible (parties can define the rules/procedures to some extent) and they can select an arbitrator with specific expertise (for example, if complex finances, an arbitrator with strong financial background). Collaborative Divorce: Collaborative divorce is a newer form of ADR, formalized in New Jersey by the New Jersey Family Collaborative Law Act (effective 2014). In a collaborative divorce, each spouse hires a specially trained collaborative attorney, and all parties sign an agreement committing to resolve the divorce without litigation and in a cooperative manner. The process involves a series of four-way meetings (both spouses and both attorneys) and often additional collaborative professionals, such as neutral financial specialists or divorce coaches and child specialists, all working as a team. The hallmark of collaborative law is that if the process fails and the parties decide to go to court, the collaborative attorneys must withdraw and the spouses must hire new litigation counsel. This creates a strong incentive for everyone to stay at the table and work hard toward settlement, since “failing” means starting over from scratch in court. The collaborative team shares information voluntarily (no formal discovery battles) and focuses on creative problem-solving to meet the core needs of both parties​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
. The approach is meant to reduce the adversarial nature of divorce and view it more as a series of mutual problems to be solved (financial planning for two households, co-parenting arrangements, etc.), often with a “win-win” mindset rather than win-lose​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
. Collaborative sessions may address one issue at a time, for example, first budgeting and support, then asset division, then parenting plan. The presence of neutral experts (agreed to by both) helps ensure decisions are based on solid information – e.g., a neutral financial analyst might model various settlement options to show long-term outcomes for each party. The process is confidential and by design less acrimonious; it emphasizes open communication and can preserve a better relationship between the ex-spouses (important when co-parenting). Not every case is suitable – if there is a significant imbalance of power or a party is hiding information, it can falter. But when successful, collaborative divorce often results in a comprehensive settlement that both sides are satisfied with, achieved without court intervention or hostility​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
​
WEINBERGERLAWGROUP.COM
. It effectively combines the benefits of mediation (cooperative spirit) with the security of having your own lawyer by your side to advise and advocate (but in a collaborative fashion). New Jersey’s embrace of collaborative law reflects the state’s policy to encourage dispute resolution that minimizes conflict and emotional cost. In summary, New Jersey provides multiple avenues for couples to resolve divorce issues outside the traditional courtroom trial. Many divorces are settled through a combination of these ADR methods – for example, a couple might mediate most issues and arbitrate a sticking point, or engage in collaborative law and only litigate if that fails. Even when a case starts in court, judges will remind parties that settlement is often the better course. The vast majority of divorce cases in New Jersey (over 95%) end in a negotiated agreement without a trial, thanks in part to these ADR processes. They empower the parties to have a say in the outcome, reduce the financial and emotional strain of protracted litigation, and often lead to more durable agreements (since both sides had a hand in crafting the terms). ADR has become a cornerstone of New Jersey divorce practice, aligning with the understanding that while marriages end, the process of ending them need not destroy the family’s finances or relationships.
Recent and Landmark Cases in New Jersey Divorce Law
To illustrate New Jersey divorce principles in action, it is helpful to examine several landmark and recent cases that have shaped the law:
Painter v. Painter (1974): This early Supreme Court of New Jersey case was pivotal in interpreting the brand-new equitable distribution statute. The court held that property owned by a spouse prior to the marriage is not subject to equitable distribution, and it clarified that any increase in value of that pre-marital property during the marriage is also immune from distribution, absent contribution by the other spouse​
LAWPIPE.COM
. Painter established the baseline definitions of “marital property” versus “separate property” that are still used today. It confirmed that equitable distribution is not an automatic 50/50 division of everything the couple owns, but applies only to assets acquired during the marriage. This case (along with a couple of companion cases the same year) provided the foundation for how courts handle asset division, emphasizing fairness and the need to exclude pre-marital contributions from division to avoid a windfall to either party.
Rothman v. Rothman (1974): Decided shortly after Painter, Rothman is notable for delineating the three-step process for equitable distribution (identify marital assets, value them, and distribute equitably)​
SHAWDIVORCE.COM
. It also underscored that a homemaker’s contributions count as much as a breadwinner’s in acquiring marital assets – reinforcing the partnership theory of marriage. Rothman and Painter together cemented New Jersey’s equitable distribution regime.
Lepis v. Lepis (1980): A landmark in the area of alimony and child support modifications, Lepis set forth the rule that support provisions (whether set by agreement or court order) remain subject to future modification on a showing of “changed circumstances.”​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
. In Lepis, the wife had agreed to modest alimony in the original divorce but later sought an increase as her financial needs grew and the husband’s ability to pay had improved. The Supreme Court held that courts have continuing jurisdiction to review and modify support if the circumstances that existed at the time of the divorce have substantially changed (for example, a significant increase or decrease in either party’s income, change in cost of living, illness or disability, etc.). The case gave a non-exhaustive list of what could constitute changed circumstances and made clear that even if the parties had a settlement agreement saying alimony is waivable or fixed, the court could override that if justice required (although in practice, truly bargained-for nonmodifiable agreements might be honored absent extreme hardship). Lepis remains the cornerstone case cited whenever a party files a motion to adjust alimony or child support post-divorce – it stands for the principle that support arrangements are always subject to the equitable power of the court to ensure fairness over time​
ROBINWERNIK.COM
.
Newburgh v. Arrigo (1982): This is the seminal case regarding college expenses and child support. In Newburgh, the Supreme Court considered whether a divorced father could be compelled to contribute to his son’s college education at Rutgers. The Court ruled that divorced parents may indeed be required to pay for a child’s college, and it outlined a series of factors to determine when such contribution is appropriate​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
. These factors include whether the parent, if still living with the child, would have helped pay for college; the parent’s ability to pay; the child’s aptitude and commitment to education; the relationship of the education request to the child’s goals; and the resources of the child (scholarships, loans, etc.), among others​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
​
MEZLAWYERS.COM
. Newburgh thus expanded the concept of parental obligation beyond age 18 in appropriate cases and has led to many instances of courts allocating college costs between parents. It is frequently cited in motions when a parent seeks contribution for college tuition from the other parent. The principles from Newburgh were later codified in part by the 2017 statute that presumptively ends support at 19 but allows extension for college: effectively, if a child is still in college, that child is not emancipated and support continues (and college expenses are considered separately in light of Newburgh factors). This case is a distinctive feature of New Jersey law, as not all states make divorced parents pay for college; New Jersey, through Newburgh, says they can be required to if it’s in the child’s best interests and the parents have the ability.
Mani v. Mani (2005): This modern case dealt with marital fault and alimony. The question was whether a spouse’s infidelity (marital fault) could be a factor in denying or reducing alimony. The Supreme Court in Mani reaffirmed the state’s no-fault approach to financial issues, holding that ordinary marital misconduct (like adultery) is not to be considered in alimony decisions​
STUDICATA.COM
. The Court carved out only two narrow exceptions: (1) cases where the fault impacted the couple’s economic life (e.g., if one spouse’s misconduct resulted in dissipation of assets or other financial harm, which is actually more of an economic factor than moral fault), and (2) cases of “egregious fault” – very rare situations where a spouse’s conduct is so outrageous that to enforce alimony would be unjust (the Court gave examples such as a spouse plotting to murder the other)​
STUDICATA.COM
. In Mani, because the misconduct was an affair that had no direct financial impact, the cheating wife still had to pay alimony to the husband. This case is often cited to clients who think, for example, that they can avoid paying alimony because their spouse cheated – in New Jersey, that’s not a valid argument, per Mani. It underscores New Jersey’s policy that financial awards in divorce are about support and need, not punishing wrongdoing.
Bisbing v. Bisbing (2017): A very significant recent Supreme Court case in the area of child custody – relocation. This decision marked a change in how NJ courts handle a custodial parent’s request to relocate out of state with a child. Prior to Bisbing, a standard from a case called Baures v. Lewis (2001) applied, which was more lenient if the primary custodian wanted to move (requiring good faith and no harm to child). In Bisbing, the mother had primary custody and sought to move with the children to another state, and the father opposed. The Supreme Court held that when parents share legal custody (which is most cases), any relocation must be assessed under the child’s best interests standard, rather than the older Baures standard​
COOPERLEVENSON.COM
. The Court essentially discarded the presumption that a primary custodian’s move should normally be allowed. Now, the parent seeking to relocate must show the move is in the child’s best interests, considering the same factors as an original custody determination​
COOPERLEVENSON.COM
. Bisbing “upended 16 years of law” on relocation​
COOPERLEVENSON.COM
, making it more difficult for a parent to move children out of New Jersey over the other parent’s objection. It was a response to the modern realities of co-parenting and both parents often being very involved – it ensures that a move that would drastically alter the child’s relationship with the left-behind parent is only approved if truly best for the child (not simply because the moving parent will be happier or even if they have a good-faith reason like a new job or remarriage). Post-Bisbing, many relocation cases require a full hearing, and some moves are disallowed or a change of custody is ordered if one parent decides to move without the child. This case is now the guiding precedent for relocation, emphasizing that a child’s right to have both parents in their life is a central concern.
These cases (among others) form the legal tapestry of New Jersey divorce law. Each exemplifies how courts balance the statutes with real-life complexities: Painter and Rothman establishing fairness in dividing assets, Lepis allowing flexibility in support orders, Newburgh extending parental support obligations to higher education, Mani keeping moral judgments out of alimony, and Bisbing prioritizing children’s interests in mobility disputes. High-profile divorces in New Jersey – such as those involving public figures – often invoke these principles. For instance, if a celebrity in New Jersey divorces, their case will likely quietly apply the above rules (equitable distribution of their wealth, support based on need and ability, etc.), unless a novel issue arises. One could say New Jersey’s divorce jurisprudence is both comprehensive and evolving: comprehensive in covering all aspects of marital dissolution, and evolving as societal norms change (e.g., the shift towards viewing both parents as equally important, reflected in Bisbing, or the 2014 updates to alimony reflecting modern expectations). By studying these landmark rulings, one gains insight into the rationale behind the statutes and how abstract legal standards are applied to concrete situations, thus enriching an understanding of divorce law in the Garden State.
