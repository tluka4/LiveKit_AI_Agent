Welcome. I understand that navigating divorce can be overwhelming and deeply personal. In New Jersey, the process is guided by statutes and court rulings that aim to ensure fairness and clarity, but what matters most is how it impacts your life — emotionally, financially, and practically.

Let’s walk through this together, step by step.

New Jersey law allows for both no-fault and fault-based divorce. Many people today choose no-fault options like irreconcilable differences, especially when both parties simply feel the relationship has reached an end. If you've been living separately for at least 18 months, that's also a valid basis. That said, if specific misconduct occurred — like adultery, abandonment, or cruelty — the law does allow those as grounds too.

You don’t have to know exactly which ground applies to your case. We can talk about your situation, and I’ll help explain which path might be most appropriate. It's not about pointing fingers — it’s about making sure you feel heard and protected.

Residency matters too. One of you must have lived in New Jersey for at least a year before filing (except in some adultery cases). Once you're ready, the process starts by filing a Complaint for Divorce with the Superior Court. That document lays out the reason for the divorce and what you’re requesting — like property division, support, or parenting arrangements.

Now, I want to make sure you understand what comes next. After filing, your spouse must be formally notified. If they don’t respond within 35 days, the court may allow the case to proceed without them. But if they do respond, both of you will have opportunities to share financial details, express preferences for custody, and work toward an agreement — or let the court help resolve disagreements.

Most people prefer to settle their divorce through guided negotiation. New Jersey offers Early Settlement Panels and mediation to help couples avoid a drawn-out court process. If an agreement is reached, it can be finalized quickly. If not, the case moves to trial, where a judge will make the final decisions.

When it comes to dividing property, New Jersey uses a system called equitable distribution — meaning fair, not necessarily equal. Things you acquired together during the marriage (like homes, bank accounts, investments, or even furniture) are typically divided. But something you owned before marriage, or received as a gift or inheritance, may be considered separate.

We’ll take time to understand your assets, what matters most to you, and how your contributions — whether financial or through caregiving — are recognized in the law.

Alimony is another important topic. If one spouse needs support to transition into life post-divorce, the court may award temporary or long-term alimony. This depends on the length of the marriage, each person's income, health, and ability to maintain the lifestyle you built together.

There are different types of alimony — some help a spouse get back on their feet, others compensate for sacrifices made during the marriage, like supporting a partner through school or leaving a career to care for family.

You're not alone in this. If you’re unsure how to begin or what applies to your life, just start by sharing your story. I’ll guide you through the legal framework with compassion, helping you make informed choices every step of the way.

Whether you’re concerned about custody, your finances, or just what comes next — I’m here to support and explain, not just answer.
